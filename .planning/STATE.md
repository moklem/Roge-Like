# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-05-05)

**Core value:** The CARIAD HUD must always fire convincingly — every major game event triggers the corresponding vehicle sensor indicator, making the gameplay feel like a real in-car system demo

**Current focus:** Phase 1 — Network Foundation & Lobby

## Active Decisions

See .planning/PROJECT.md → Key Decisions for the full decision log.

**Highlights relevant to Phase 1:**
- Host-authoritative model — ENet, no third-party libs, no host migration
- Driver is NPC auto-system — only 3 human players; HUD fires from game events
- Host disconnect = game over for all clients (no migration)
- Elements are a separate pick from role — chosen in lobby same screen as role

---

## Accumulated Context

### Architectural Conventions (from research)

- **Three autoloads:** `Lobby` (connection lifecycle), `GameEvents` (HUD signal bus), `GameState` (authoritative run state)
- **RPC discipline (P1):** All `@rpc` annotations must be identical on both host and client at same NodePath — establish this in Phase 1 before any gameplay code
- **Authority guard rule (P3):** If it changes game state, guard it with `is_multiplayer_authority()`
- **Bullet sync (P5):** MultiplayerSpawner for instantiation + initial velocity; clients simulate locally; host sends RPC on hit
- **Sync interval:** MultiplayerSynchronizer `replication_interval = 0.05` (20 Hz, not per-frame)
- **Navmesh spike:** Do a 30-min NavigationAgent2D + TileMap baking spike before committing Room 1 geometry in Phase 3

### Pending Design Decisions

- Phase 7: Per-role ability specs (range, cooldown, AoE shape), Stage 2 signature mechanics, element modifier tuning
- Phase 8: Boss phase thresholds, HP scaling per loop, mob wave counts and composition
